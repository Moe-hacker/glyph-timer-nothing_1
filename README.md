# About:
Written with C, just for fun.      
You need to root your phone to use this program.         
It's not an Android app because I haven't learned Java.      
# How to install:
It runs in termux, install termux in your phone first, and then:      
```
pkg in git make clang
git clone https://github.com/Moe-hacker/glyph-timer-nothing_1
cd glyph-timer-nothing
make install
```
# Usage:
```
gtimer -h [hours] -m [minutes] -s [seconds]
```
